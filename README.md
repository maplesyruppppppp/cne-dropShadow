# Drop Shadow Shader Stage Extension for Codename Engine

This is a stage extension that adds the drop shadow shader used in V-Slice to Codename Engine. (The shader you see in the senpai and tankmen erect stages)

Codename V1 or higher IS required. Previous versions (v0.1) will not work properly.

In your stage xml file, put in `<use-extension script="dropshadow-effect"/>` to import the script.

To understand how to use the stage extension, read [this tutorial](TUTORIAL.md).
